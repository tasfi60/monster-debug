                                            <br>
                                            The major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.

                                        <li><b>LocalStorage :</b>LocalStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.

                                        <li>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java. <br><br>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Before we discuss the event loop, lets first go through the function of the task queue.

                                            nce the Web API finishes executing the task, it doesn’t just push it back to the Call Stack automatically. It goes to the Task Queue. 
                                            
                                            A queue is a data structure that works on the First in First out principle, so as tasks get pushed into the queue, they get out in that same order. Tasks that have been executed by the Web API’s, which are being pushed to the Task Queue, then go back to the Call Stack to get their result printed out. <br><br>
                    
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
